					<h3>The Road to Enlightenment</h3>
					<p>On a sandy, luxurious beach a pirate in his huge ship landed on the shore. He was frantically running around looking for something while counting his steps. In his hand he held a long, golden scroll. He dropped to his knees at ‘x marks the spot’ and appeared very sad for some reason! His treasure had been discovered and taken by someone or something… <abbr

						<h3>So What is This About?</h3>
						<p> 
                            The pirate looked at his treasure map for directions to the dinosaurs and followed it carefully making sure he didn’t go the wrong way into a soggy, sinking swamp. When he arrived at the dinosaur’s home, he saw them all having a huge fancy dress party wearing all of his magnificent treasure. He approached the tallest Dinosaur and asked why they had taken his treasure, The dinosaurs sympathetically explained that they didn’t realise it was the pirate’s treasure they just found it and thought it would be great to wear it for their fancy dress party! The pirate understood and told the dinosaurs they could share it! The dinosaur’s where so happy that they invited the pirate to join the party. Everybody danced and ate cake for they were all friends and the pirate had found his long lost treasure!!!
